# Development
#### Install Dependencies

We have three kinds of dependencies in this project: tools, database and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* Get the libraries we depend upon via `npm` & the angular code via `bower`
* Create the postgres DB via [1_build_db.sql](sql/sql/1_build_db)

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` simply run:

```
npm install
```

Two new folders will appear in your project

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `public/components` - contains the angular framework files

#### Create Postgres DB
* Run script [1_build_db.sql](app/sql/1_build_db.sql)
* Add [settings file](settings-example.js)

#### Run the Application

Run the web server

```
npm start
```

### Development
Watch for changes and build all js files into _public/app/build/kanye.min.js_

```
grunt build watch
```
